# Autoservice_C++
This application ensures efficient management of car service orders, user authentication, and detailed tracking of services and users. You can check its *features* in the **Features** file.

## How to get the application up and running
1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Create a new "build" using CMake (but you need to specify the correct path and version of your Qt in the "CMakeLists" file first).
3. In Visual Studio Community you need to set "ImageViewer" as Startup project.
4. Now you can run the application.
